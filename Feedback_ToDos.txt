To do (from highest to lowest priority):

- Fix linesplits
- When closing the chat, return to the last message when opening it
- Be able to change border color on the map, not just the cell's border color
- Update friend_names more frequently for sigfixes
- Fix for text outlines and shadows
- Play timer and mouse tracker overlap and only appear when you refresh the page after activating, and don't disappear after deactivating
